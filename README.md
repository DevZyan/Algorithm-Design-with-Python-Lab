# **Algorithm-Design-with-Python-Lab**
This repository contains implementations as part of the **Algorithm Design Lab**.

## **Labs**
1. **Optimization of Insertion Sort**
   - using binary search instead of linear search
   - shifting two elements instead of one
       - two elements were shifted by first shifting the max element to its place then searching the array till max element and then placing the min element
2. **Optimization of Quick Sort**
   - taking a pivot which is median of three random elements chosen from the array, this avoids the worst case time complexity
